# 🛍️ Ecommerce Sales Segmentation  

## 📖 Overview  
This project performs **customer segmentation analysis** based on e-commerce sales data.  
By applying **machine learning clustering techniques**, it helps identify distinct customer groups using behavioral and transactional data.  

The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for **marketing strategy, customer retention, and personalization**.

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization of key metrics.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Deriving key variables such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM).  
- **Segmentation Model:** Implementation of **K-Means clustering** to group customers based on purchasing behavior.  
- **Model Saving:** Trained model stored as `.pkl` file for easy reuse.  
- **Visualization:** Cluster insights using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Power BI (optional).  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  
  - pickle  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Ecommerce_Sales_Segmentation.git
cd Ecommerce_Sales_Segmentation


Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🧩 Usage

Run the main notebook

jupyter notebook notebooks/Ecommerce_Sales_Segmentation.ipynb


Load and use the trained model

import pickle

with open('models/ecommerce_segmentation_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

cluster_labels = model.predict(new_data)


Visualize results

View cluster distributions and behavioral insights.

Optionally, connect to Power BI or Tableau for dashboard visualization.

## 📊 Example Insights

High-value customers purchase frequently with short recency periods.

Occasional buyers form the majority but contribute less to revenue.

Targeted retention strategies can increase sales efficiency.

## 📈 Future Improvements

Integrate automated data pipelines for live segmentation updates.

Implement Prophet or ARIMA for sales forecasting.

Deploy as a Flask or Streamlit dashboard app.
